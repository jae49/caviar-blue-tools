## Original Plan

I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end. Make sure you fix all the linting, compilation or validation issues after successful implementation of the plan.

### Observations

I analyzed the caviar-blue-tools Reed-Solomon implementation and found that the current polynomial division-based encoding cannot guarantee reconstruction from arbitrary k-out-of-n shard combinations. The erasure_notes.md document clearly outlines this limitation and proposes Option 1: implementing a complete systematic Reed-Solomon code using Vandermonde or Cauchy matrices. The codebase has solid GF(256) arithmetic, comprehensive test coverage, streaming support, and performance optimizations, but all are built on the flawed polynomial division foundation.

### Approach

I'll implement Option 1 through a **5-phase approach** that allows for incremental development, testing, and deployment:

**Phase 1: Foundation** - Build core matrix utilities and basic systematic encoder/decoder as standalone components
**Phase 2: Integration** - Add algorithm selection to existing components and enable side-by-side operation  
**Phase 3: Performance & Optimization** - Update performance components and add systematic algorithm optimizations
**Phase 4: Testing & Validation** - Comprehensive testing, validation, and regression testing
**Phase 5: Documentation & Migration** - Update documentation, provide migration guidance, and establish systematic as the recommended approach

This phased approach ensures each stage delivers working functionality while building toward the complete solution. Early phases focus on proving the mathematical foundation works, middle phases integrate with existing systems, and later phases optimize and document the solution.

### Reasoning

I explored the repository structure and identified the core Reed-Solomon files, mathematical infrastructure, data models, performance optimizations, streaming implementation, and test patterns. I read the erasure_notes.md document which clearly explained the fundamental issue with polynomial division encoding and outlined Option 1 as the solution. I examined the current encoder/decoder implementations, GaloisField arithmetic, PolynomialMath utilities, and various test files to understand the existing architecture and identify integration points.

## Proposed File Changes

### docs/plans/PHASE_1_FOUNDATION.md(NEW)

References: 

- docs/plans/erasure_notes.md(MODIFY)

Create a phase 1 planning document that outlines:

- **Objective**: Build and validate core matrix-based Reed-Solomon components
- **Deliverables**: MatrixUtils, SystematicRSEncoder, SystematicRSDecoder as standalone components
- **Success Criteria**: Basic round-trip encoding/decoding works for simple test cases
- **Dependencies**: None (uses existing GaloisField)
- **Timeline**: Foundation for all subsequent phases
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for matrix operations and basic integration tests
- **Risk Mitigation**: Isolated development prevents disruption to existing functionality

This phase establishes the mathematical foundation and proves the systematic approach works before any integration with existing systems.

### src/main/kotlin/cb/core/tools/erasure/matrix(NEW)

Create a new package for matrix-based Reed-Solomon implementation components. This package will contain the systematic Reed-Solomon encoder, decoder, and matrix utilities for Phase 1.

### src/main/kotlin/cb/core/tools/erasure/matrix/MatrixUtils.kt(NEW)

References: 

- src/main/kotlin/cb/core/tools/erasure/math/GaloisField.kt

**PHASE 1**: Create a utility class for GF(256) matrix operations including:

- `generateVandermondeMatrix(k: Int, n: Int): Array<IntArray>` - Creates an nÃ—k Vandermonde matrix where element [i][j] = Î±^(i*j) with Î± being primitive elements of GF(256)
- `invertMatrix(matrix: Array<IntArray>): Array<IntArray>?` - Inverts a kÃ—k submatrix using Gaussian elimination in GF(256)
- `multiplyMatrixVector(matrix: Array<IntArray>, vector: IntArray): IntArray` - Matrix-vector multiplication in GF(256)
- `extractSubmatrix(matrix: Array<IntArray>, rowIndices: List<Int>): Array<IntArray>` - Extracts a submatrix for decoding

All operations use the existing `GaloisField` object for arithmetic. Focus on correctness over performance in Phase 1 - optimizations come in Phase 3.
**PHASE 3**: Add performance optimizations to matrix utilities:

- Add matrix caching for common (k,n) configurations
- Implement optimized matrix-vector multiplication with loop unrolling
- Add parallel processing for large matrices
- Implement block-wise matrix operations for better cache locality
- Add SIMD-style optimizations where possible in Kotlin/JVM
- Add Cauchy matrix generation as alternative to Vandermonde for better numerical properties

Focus on making matrix operations competitive with polynomial division performance.

### src/main/kotlin/cb/core/tools/erasure/matrix/SystematicRSEncoder.kt(NEW)

References: 

- src/main/kotlin/cb/core/tools/erasure/ReedSolomonEncoder.kt(MODIFY)
- src/main/kotlin/cb/core/tools/erasure/models/EncodingConfig.kt(MODIFY)
- src/main/kotlin/cb/core/tools/erasure/models/Shard.kt

**PHASE 1**: Create a standalone systematic Reed-Solomon encoder that:

- Implements a simple interface `encode(data: ByteArray, dataShards: Int, parityShards: Int): List<ByteArray>`
- Uses matrix multiplication instead of polynomial division for parity generation
- Processes data byte-by-byte to maintain compatibility with existing patterns
- Uses `MatrixUtils.generateVandermondeMatrix()` to create encoding matrices
- Maintains systematic property where data shards contain original data unchanged
- Focuses on correctness and simplicity - no caching or performance optimizations yet

This is a minimal implementation to prove the mathematical approach works before integration with existing `EncodingConfig` and `Shard` structures.
**PHASE 2**: Update systematic encoder to integrate with existing infrastructure:

- Change interface to match `ReedSolomonEncoder`: `encode(data: ByteArray, config: EncodingConfig): List<Shard>`
- Use `EncodingConfig` for parameters instead of individual values
- Create proper `Shard` objects with correct metadata and indexing
- Add checksum calculation and `ShardMetadata` creation
- Maintain chunk processing for large data like existing encoder
- Add matrix caching for repeated (k,n) configurations

This makes the systematic encoder a drop-in replacement for the polynomial encoder.

### src/main/kotlin/cb/core/tools/erasure/matrix/SystematicRSDecoder.kt(NEW)

References: 

- src/main/kotlin/cb/core/tools/erasure/ReedSolomonDecoder.kt(MODIFY)
- src/main/kotlin/cb/core/tools/erasure/models/ReconstructionResult.kt
- src/main/kotlin/cb/core/tools/erasure/models/Shard.kt

**PHASE 1**: Create a standalone systematic Reed-Solomon decoder that:

- Implements a simple interface `decode(shards: List<ByteArray>, shardIndices: List<Int>, dataShards: Int, totalShards: Int): ByteArray?`
- Handles any k shards out of n total shards by extracting and inverting the appropriate submatrix
- Uses `MatrixUtils` for all matrix operations
- Processes reconstruction byte-by-byte for consistency
- Returns null on failure, reconstructed data on success
- Focuses on correctness - no advanced error handling or performance optimizations

This minimal implementation proves that arbitrary k-out-of-n reconstruction works before integration with existing `ReconstructionResult` and error handling systems.
**PHASE 2**: Update systematic decoder to integrate with existing infrastructure:

- Change interface to match `ReedSolomonDecoder`: `decode(shards: List<Shard>): ReconstructionResult`
- Use `Shard` objects and extract configuration from metadata
- Return proper `ReconstructionResult.Success` or `ReconstructionResult.Failure` with appropriate error codes
- Add checksum validation using existing mechanism
- Handle chunk processing for multi-chunk data
- Add proper error handling for insufficient shards, corrupted data, etc.

This makes the systematic decoder a drop-in replacement for the polynomial decoder.
