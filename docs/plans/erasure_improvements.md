I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end. Make sure you fix all the linting, compilation or validation issues after successful implementation of the plan.

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Investigation & Test Coverage ✅ COMPLETED (2025-07-19)

**Summary**: Phase 1 has been successfully completed. Created comprehensive test coverage that reproduces and validates the specific failure patterns.

- Baseline tests for working scenarios pass correctly
- Multiple shard combination patterns fail with current implementation
- Tests compile successfully and are integrated into the build system

**Next Steps**: Proceed to Phase 2 to fix the mathematical foundation.

### Phase 2: Mathematical Foundation ✅ COMPLETED (2025-07-20)

**Summary**: Phase 2 has been successfully completed. Created a syndrome-based Reed-Solomon decoder that provides the mathematical foundation for robust decoding.

**Deliverables**:
- `SyndromeDecoder.kt` - Syndrome-based Reed-Solomon decoder with matrix-based reconstruction
- `SyndromeDecoderTest.kt` - 13 comprehensive unit tests (11 passing, 2 failing on edge cases)

- Failing tests are primarily related to non-contiguous shard reconstruction (known issue)

**Next Steps**: Phase 6 has been proposed to address the remaining integration issues and ensure all tests pass.

### Observations

I've analyzed the Reed-Solomon erasure coding library and identified the root cause of the "corrupted shards" errors. The issue lies in the decoder's implementation which has several limitations:

1. **Byte-by-byte processing limitation**: The current `ReedSolomonDecoder` processes one byte at a time and only uses the first byte of each shard for polynomial reconstruction, which breaks with non-contiguous shard combinations.

2. **Incomplete Reed-Solomon implementation**: The `PolynomialMath.systematicReedSolomonDecode()` method has hardcoded assumptions and fallback mechanisms that don't handle all valid shard combinations.

3. **Fast-path dependency**: The decoder relies too heavily on having all data shards present for the "fast path" and doesn't properly fall back to full Reed-Solomon reconstruction.

4. **Robust decoder exists but isn't used**: There's already a `RobustReedSolomonDecoder` in the performance package that has better error handling and validation, but it still suffers from the same mathematical limitations.

### Approach

The plan addresses the Reed-Solomon decoder limitations through a systematic phased approach:

**Phase 1: Investigation & Test Coverage** - Create comprehensive test coverage to reproduce and validate the specific failure patterns, establishing a clear baseline for the issues.

**Phase 2: Mathematical Foundation** - Fix the core mathematical implementation by creating a proper syndrome-based Reed-Solomon decoder with robust error correction algorithms.

**Phase 3: Decoder Integration** - Enhance the main decoder logic to utilize the improved mathematical foundation and handle arbitrary shard combinations correctly.

**Phase 4: Enhanced Error Handling** - Improve error reporting, validation, and configuration options to provide better diagnostics and user experience.

**Phase 5: Performance & Documentation** - Ensure no performance regression, create comprehensive documentation, and validate the complete solution.

This phased approach ensures mathematical correctness first, then integration, optimization, and user experience improvements.

### Reasoning

I explored the codebase systematically, starting with the main decoder implementation and mathematical foundations. I examined the existing test suite to understand current coverage, reviewed the models and configuration classes, and discovered a more robust decoder implementation in the performance package. I also checked for existing TODOs and known issues. This comprehensive analysis revealed that while the library has good structure and some robust components, the core mathematical implementation has fundamental limitations that prevent it from handling all valid shard combinations.

- Include the specific failing case: n=8, k=5, missing shards [0,3,6], remaining [1,2,4,5,7]
- Test edge cases like missing only data shards, only parity shards, and mixed combinations
- Use property-based testing to validate that any k shards out of n can reconstruct the original data
- Include performance benchmarks for different combination patterns
- Mark currently failing tests with `@Disabled` and detailed failure descriptions

The test will serve as both a reproducer for current issues and a validation suite for the fixes.

### src/test/kotlin/cb/core/tools/erasure/RegressionTest.kt(NEW) ✅ COMPLETED

References: 

- src/test/kotlin/cb/core/tools/erasure/RequestedIntegrationTest.kt
